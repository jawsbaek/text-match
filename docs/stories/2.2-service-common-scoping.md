# Story 2.2: Service/Common Scoping & Inheritance

Status: Draft

## Story

As an editor,
I want visualization of service/common scoping and overrides,
so that I understand inheritance and conflicts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Override warnings and conflict detection
- Filtering by scope in browse view

## Dev Notes

- PRD §5 FR-2 Service/Common Scoping

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Compute effective value per key given service/common
- [ ] Mark overrides and conflicts in API response
- [ ] UI flagging (chips) for scope on list/detail

## Testing

## QA Results
