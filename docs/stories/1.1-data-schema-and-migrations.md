# Story 1.1: Data Schema & Drizzle Migrations

Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want normalized schemas and reproducible migrations for core entities,
so that we can persist and evolve product data safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Drizzle schemas for: Service, Namespace, Key, Translation, User, Role, Permission map, Event (audit)
- FKs/uniques align with PRD ยง9; enums for statuses and locales
- drizzle-kit migrations generated; up/down runnable locally and in CI
- Seed script creates minimal bootstrap data (one service, locales)

## Dev Notes

- Entities reference: PRD ยง9
- Migrations via drizzle-kit; ensure rollback for empty DB works

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Define Drizzle schemas for all listed entities
- [ ] Add relations, indexes, and constraints
- [ ] Generate migrations and verify up/down
- [ ] Implement seed script (service + locales)
- [ ] Unit tests for schema constraints (where applicable)

## Testing

- Run migration up/down locally
- Validate seed data presence
- Verify constraints by attempting invalid inserts

## QA Results
