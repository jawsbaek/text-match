# Story 1.6: Mutation Audit Log

Status: Done

## Story

As a reviewer,
I want an audit trail of changes,
so that we know who changed what and when.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Event row per create/update/delete of Keys/Translations
- Captures actor, action, entity ref, before/after, timestamp
- GET /api/events?entity=... lists events; sensitive data redacted

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.5 established comprehensive audit logging patterns for import/export operations
- Existing import/export endpoints already log events to event table with actor and changes
- Event logging includes before/after state in audit events [Source: docs/stories/1.5-json-import-export.md]
- Existing CRUD endpoints from Story 1.4 provide patterns for request validation and response formatting
- Auth middleware and RBAC enforcement patterns are established and working

### Data Models

- **event table**: `(id, actor, action, entity_type, entity_id, before jsonb, after jsonb, created_at)` for audit trail [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md#72-l10n]
- **l10n_key table**: `(id, service_id, namespace_id, key_name, tags[], status, created_at, updated_at)` [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md#72-l10n]
- **translation table**: `(id, key_id, locale, value, status, version, checksum, created_at, updated_at)` [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md#72-l10n]
- **Database indexes**: event table has indexes on entity_type, entity_id, and created_at for efficient querying [Source: src/lib/db/schema/l10n.schema.ts]

### API Specifications

- **Events Endpoint**: `GET /api/events?entity=...` with filtering and pagination [Source: epics/epic-1-foundation-m0.md#16-mutation-audit-log]
- **Request Validation**: Use Zod schemas at route boundary [Source: architecture/9-validation-errors-logging.md]
- **Response Format**: Return `Response` objects with proper `content-type` headers [Source: architecture/5-backend-server-routes.md]
- **Auth Requirements**: Apply auth middleware to all `/api/**` endpoints with 401/403 responses [Source: architecture/5-backend-server-routes.md]
- **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Redact sensitive fields in API responses as needed for security

### File Locations

- **Events Route**: `src/routes/api/events.ts` [Source: architecture/4-repository-structure-selected.md]
- **Database Client**: Use shared client from `src/lib/db/index.ts` [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md]
- **Event Schema**: Already defined in `src/lib/db/schema/l10n.schema.ts` [Source: architecture/4-repository-structure-selected.md]
- **Auth Middleware**: Existing middleware at `src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` [Source: architecture/6-authentication-authorization.md]

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Zod schemas for events query parameters and response validation [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]
- **Integration Tests**: DB-backed tests under `tests/integration/` using Docker Postgres [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]
- **Test Structure**: Colocated unit tests under `src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]
- **Test Priorities**: Validate query parameter schemas, auth middleware 401/403, event filtering logic, and redaction behavior [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]

### Technical Constraints

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, snake_case conventions [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: TanStack Start server routes via `createServerFileRoute` [Source: architecture/5-backend-server-routes.md]
- **Performance**: P95 ≤ 300ms for list endpoints at 5k keys, applies to events endpoint [Source: epics/epic-1-foundation-m0.md#cross-cutting-nfrs-m0]
- **Error Handling**: 400 for validation errors, 401 for unauthorized [Source: architecture/9-validation-errors-logging.md]
- **Logging**: Structured logs with request correlation [Source: architecture/9-validation-errors-logging.md]
- **Security**: Sensitive data redaction for compliance and privacy protection

### Event Tracking Implementation Details

- Event logging is already implemented for import/export operations in Story 1.5
- Need to extend event logging to individual CRUD operations on keys and translations
- Event capture should include: actor (from auth context), action (create/update/delete), entity_type, entity_id, before/after states
- Existing event table structure supports all required audit fields
- Database indexes already exist for efficient event querying

### Query Parameters and Filtering

- Support entity filtering: `?entity=key&entityId=123` or `?entity=translation&entityId=456`
- Support pagination for large event logs
- Support date range filtering for audit compliance
- Consider actor filtering for administrative review

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid software engineering practices with clean separation of concerns, comprehensive test coverage, and proper TypeScript typing. The audit logging system correctly captures CRUD operations with before/after states and provides a well-designed REST API for querying events. All acceptance criteria have been fully implemented with appropriate validation and error handling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/lib/audit/**tests**/event-logger.test.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed TypeScript type assertions from `any` to proper interfaces
  - **Why**: Improve type safety and eliminate unsafe type coercion
  - **How**: Added `TestKeyData` and `TestTranslationData` interfaces for proper typing

- **File**: src/routes/api/events.ts
  - **Change**: Corrected export name from `Route` to `ServerRoute`
  - **Why**: Match TanStack Start routing conventions used throughout codebase
  - **How**: Ensures proper route registration and TypeScript compilation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows established patterns and TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed in correct locations per architecture guidelines
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests for validation and integration patterns
- All ACs Met: ✓ Event logging, API endpoint, and redaction all implemented correctly

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed TypeScript type safety issues in test files
- [x] Corrected route export naming for proper TanStack integration
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage for all major code paths
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Added time-based query limits for large event datasets (30-day default, 90-day max)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Enhanced PII redaction with pattern-based detection (emails, phones, API keys, sensitive field names)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Added performance monitoring for event query response times with P95 alerts
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implemented comprehensive event archiving strategy for long-term scalability

### Security Review ✅ RESOLVED

**ENHANCED**: PII redaction now implements sophisticated pattern-based detection including:

- Email addresses (`/\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b/g`)
- Phone numbers (`/(\+?1[-.\s]?)?\(?([0-9]{3})\)?[-.\s]?([0-9]{3})[-.\s]?([0-9]{4})/g`)
- Credit card numbers, SSNs, API keys (20+ character sequences)
- Sensitive field name detection (password, secret, token, key, apiKey, etc.)
- Configurable whitelist for non-sensitive fields
- Length-based fallback for values >100 characters
- Multiple validation methods ensure comprehensive protection

### Performance Considerations ✅ RESOLVED

**OPTIMIZED**: Performance concerns have been comprehensively addressed:

- **Time-based Query Limits**: Default 30-day window, maximum 90-day window enforced
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time query duration logging with P95 threshold alerts (>300ms)
- **Database Optimization**: Existing indexes on `entity_type`, `entity_id`, and `created_at` utilized
- **Query Response**: Includes `queryInfo.duration` for client-side monitoring
- **Scalability**: Event archiving strategy designed for hot/warm/cold storage tiers
- **Load Testing**: Integration tests verify performance under realistic data volumes
