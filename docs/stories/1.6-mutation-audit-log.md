# Story 1.6: Mutation Audit Log

Status: Draft

## Story

As a reviewer,
I want an audit trail of changes,
so that we know who changed what and when.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Event row per create/update/delete of Keys/Translations
- Captures actor, action, entity ref, before/after, timestamp
- GET /api/events?entity=... lists events; sensitive data redacted

## Dev Notes

- PRD ยง5 FR-8 Auditability; ยง10 APIs (webhooks later)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement event model and write hooks on mutations
- [ ] Implement GET /api/events with pagination and filters
- [ ] Redact sensitive fields where needed

## Testing

- Verify events created for each mutation
- Verify redaction behavior

## QA Results
