# Story 1.5: JSON Import/Export with Dry‑Run

Status: Done

## Story

As a project owner,
I want JSON/ICU import/export with dry‑run capability,
so that teams can sync resources safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

- POST /api/import (dry‑run flag) returns diff/report; no mutation on dry‑run
- Import applies changes transactionally on commit
- GET /api/export?service&locales round‑trips with import for basic cases

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.4 established CRUD endpoints with Zod validation and RBAC enforcement
- Existing `/api/keys` endpoints provide patterns for request validation and response formatting

### Data Models

- **l10n_key table**: `(id, service_id, namespace_id, key_name, tags[], status, created_at, updated_at)` [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md#72-l10n]
- **translation table**: `(id, key_id, locale, value, status, version, checksum, created_at, updated_at)` [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md#72-l10n]
- **service table**: `(id, code, name, owners[], created_at, updated_at)` [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md#72-l10n]
- **event table**: `(id, actor, action, entity_type, entity_id, before jsonb, after jsonb, created_at)` for audit trail [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md#72-l10n]

### API Specifications

- **Import Endpoint**: `POST /api/import` with optional dry-run flag [Source: architecture/5-backend-server-routes.md#52-planned-endpoints-from-prd]
- **Export Endpoint**: `GET /api/export?format=json&service=web&locales=ko,ja` [Source: prd/10-apis-initial.md]
- **Request Validation**: Use Zod schemas at route boundary [Source: architecture/9-validation-errors-logging.md]
- **Response Format**: Return `Response` objects with proper `content-type` headers [Source: architecture/5-backend-server-routes.md]
- **Auth Requirements**: Apply auth middleware to all `/api/**` endpoints with 401/403 responses [Source: architecture/5-backend-server-routes.md]

### File Locations

- **Import Route**: `src/routes/api/import.ts` [Source: architecture/4-repository-structure-selected.md]
- **Export Route**: `src/routes/api/export.ts` [Source: architecture/4-repository-structure-selected.md]
- **Database Client**: Use shared client from `src/lib/db/index.ts` [Source: architecture/7-database-orm.md]
- **Schemas**: Reference l10n schemas from `src/lib/db/schema/l10n.schema.ts` [Source: architecture/4-repository-structure-selected.md]

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Zod schemas for import/export payloads [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]
- **Integration Tests**: DB-backed tests under `tests/integration/` using Docker Postgres [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]
- **Test Structure**: Colocated unit tests under `src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]
- **Test Priorities**: Validate request body schemas and error mapping (400), auth middleware 401/403 [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy-early.md]

### Technical Constraints

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, snake_case conventions [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: TanStack Start server routes via `createServerFileRoute` [Source: architecture/5-backend-server-routes.md]
- **Performance**: P95 ≤ 300ms for list endpoints at 5k keys [Source: epics/epic-1-foundation-m0.md#cross-cutting-nfrs-m0]
- **Transactions**: Transactional writes required [Source: epics/epic-1-foundation-m0.md#cross-cutting-nfrs-m0]
- **Error Handling**: 400 for validation errors, 401 for unauthorized [Source: architecture/9-validation-errors-logging.md]
- **Logging**: Structured logs with request correlation [Source: architecture/9-validation-errors-logging.md]

### JSON Format Specifications

- Export format must round-trip with import for basic cases (AC requirement)
- Support service and locale filtering in export
- Import must validate against existing key naming guardrails from story 1.4
- BCP-47 locale code validation required [Source: epics/epic-1-foundation-m0.md#14-keys--translations-crud-apis-mvp]
