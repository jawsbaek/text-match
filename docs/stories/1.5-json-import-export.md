# Story 1.5: JSON Import/Export with Dry‑Run

Status: Draft

## Story

As a project owner,
I want JSON/ICU import/export with dry‑run capability,
so that teams can sync resources safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

- POST /api/import (dry‑run flag) returns diff/report; no mutation on dry‑run
- Import applies changes transactionally on commit
- GET /api/export?service&locales round‑trips with import for basic cases

## Dev Notes

- PRD §5 FR-6; §10 APIs

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement import endpoint with dry‑run mode
- [ ] Implement export endpoint (stream large payloads)
- [ ] Diff/report structure for dry‑run
- [ ] Transactional apply on commit

## Testing

- Round‑trip test small dataset
- Dry‑run produces no mutations

## QA Results
