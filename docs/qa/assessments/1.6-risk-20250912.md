- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 85/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

No critical risks identified.

## High Risks (Score 6)

### PERF-001: Large Event Log Query Performance

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Event logs can grow very large over time
**Impact**: High - Could cause P95 response time to exceed 300ms requirement
**Risk Details**:

- Events endpoint uses standard pagination but no time-based partitioning
- Large scans on event table with filtering could become slow
- Database indexes exist but may not cover all query patterns

**Mitigation**:

- Implement time-based query restrictions (e.g., max 30 days)
- Add monitoring for query performance
- Consider archiving old events

**Testing Focus**: Load testing with realistic event volumes (10k+ events)

## Medium Risks (Score 4)

### SEC-001: Sensitive Data Exposure Through Event Logs

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Translation values might contain sensitive information
**Impact**: Medium - Could expose PII or sensitive content in audit logs
**Risk Details**:

- Current redaction only redacts values over 100 characters
- No validation of what constitutes "sensitive data"
- Redaction is simplistic and may not cover all scenarios

**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive content scanning for PII patterns
- Add configurable redaction rules
- Regular audit of redacted vs raw data

**Testing Focus**: Verify redaction works with various sensitive data patterns

### OPS-001: Event Logging Failure Impact

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Database issues or transaction failures could occur
**Impact**: Medium - Audit trail gaps could affect compliance
**Risk Details**:

- Event logging not wrapped in transaction with main CRUD operations
- No retry mechanism for failed audit logs
- Silent failures possible

**Mitigation**:

- Implement audit logging within same transaction as main operations
- Add monitoring for audit log failures
- Consider async audit logging with retry queue

**Testing Focus**: Test behavior when event logging fails

## Low Risks (Score 2-3)

### TECH-001: Authorization Inconsistency

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Risk**: Different auth patterns between Netlify Identity and better-auth could cause confusion
**Mitigation**: Standardize on single auth approach or clearly document dual-auth scenarios

### DATA-001: Event Data Integrity

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Risk**: JSON serialization/deserialization could cause data corruption
**Mitigation**: Add JSON validation and error handling

### BUS-001: Audit Log Compliance Requirements

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Risk**: Current implementation may not meet specific compliance standards
**Mitigation**: Review against specific compliance requirements (SOX, GDPR, etc.)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 medium)
- Performance: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 high)
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 low)
- Business: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 low)
- Technical: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 low)
- Operational: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 medium)

### By Component

- Events API: 2 risks
- Event Logger: 2 risks
- Database: 2 risks

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Load testing events endpoint with large datasets (>10k events)
- Performance testing with complex filtering scenarios
- Monitoring setup for query performance metrics

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Sensitive data redaction with various PII patterns
- Event logging failure scenarios and transaction rollback
- Authorization testing with different auth methods

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- JSON serialization edge cases
- Compliance audit trail format verification
- Cross-auth method compatibility

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Address Before Production

- PERF-001: Add query time limits and monitoring

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- SEC-001: Current redaction is minimal viable, can enhance iteratively
- OPS-001: Current implementation acceptable for MVP, monitor for failures

### Accepted Risks

- TECH-001, DATA-001, BUS-001: Low impact, can be addressed in future iterations

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Events endpoint response times (P95 â‰¤ 300ms)
- Event log query patterns and slow queries
- Event logging error rates
- Sensitive data exposure alerts

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Event log volume grows significantly (>100k events)
- New sensitive data types identified
- Compliance requirements change
- Performance issues reported
