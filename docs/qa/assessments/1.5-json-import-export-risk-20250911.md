- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 50/100 (Moderate Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Mass Data Corruption via Import

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Large payloads with complex relationships are error-prone
**Impact**: High (3) - Could corrupt entire service's translation data
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive transaction rollback on any validation failure
- Add pre-import validation of all relationships (service_id, key_id references)
- Implement dry-run mode that validates entire payload before any writes
- Add checksum validation for data integrity
  **Testing Focus**: Transaction rollback scenarios, large payload validation, referential integrity checks

### 2. SEC-001: Authorization Bypass in Import Operations

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex RBAC logic with service-level permissions
**Impact**: High (3) - Users could import data to services they don't own
**Mitigation**:

- Validate user permissions for target service before processing import
- Implement row-level security checks for each key/translation in payload
- Add audit logging for all import attempts (successful and failed)
- Enforce service ownership validation in dry-run mode
  **Testing Focus**: RBAC bypass scenarios, cross-service import attempts, permission escalation tests

## High Risk Issues

### 3. PERF-001: Memory Exhaustion on Large Import Payloads

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Large organizations may have 10k+ keys
**Impact**: High (3) - Could crash server or cause timeouts
**Mitigation**:

- Implement streaming JSON parsing for large payloads
- Add payload size limits with appropriate error messages
- Use batch processing for database operations
- Implement timeout handling and progress reporting
  **Testing Focus**: Large payload stress tests, memory usage monitoring, timeout scenarios

## Medium Risk Issues

### 4. TECH-001: Transaction Deadlocks in Concurrent Operations

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Multiple users importing to same service
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Failed imports requiring retry
**Mitigation**:

- Implement proper database lock ordering
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use advisory locks for service-level import operations
- Monitor for deadlock patterns in production

### 5. DATA-002: Format Incompatibility Between Import/Export

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex JSON schema evolution
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Round-trip data loss or corruption
**Mitigation**:

- Implement strict schema versioning for import/export formats
- Add comprehensive round-trip integration tests
- Include format validation in both import and export endpoints
- Document breaking changes in API versioning

### 6. OPS-001: Insufficient Error Reporting for Failed Imports

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex validation rules
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Poor user experience, debugging difficulties
**Mitigation**:

- Implement detailed error reporting with line numbers and field context
- Add structured error responses with actionable messages
- Include partial success reporting for batch operations
- Provide clear rollback status in error responses

## Low Risk Issues

### 7. PERF-002: Slow Export Performance for Large Datasets

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - P95 target is reasonable for current scale
**Impact**: High (3) - Could violate performance SLA
**Mitigation**:

- Implement database query optimization with proper indexes
- Add result streaming for large exports
- Consider pagination for very large datasets
- Monitor export performance metrics

### 8. BUS-001: Feature Doesn't Meet User Workflow Expectations

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Requirements are well-defined
**Impact**: Medium (2) - May require rework or additional features
**Mitigation**:

- Validate dry-run workflow with stakeholders
- Ensure error messages are user-friendly
- Test round-trip scenarios with real user data
- Gather feedback on JSON format usability

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Transaction Rollback Testing**: Simulate failures at various stages of import process
- **Authorization Testing**: Cross-service import attempts, permission escalation scenarios
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Referential integrity validation, checksum verification
- **Large Payload Testing**: Memory usage monitoring, timeout scenarios

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Performance Testing**: Large payload imports, concurrent user scenarios
- **Stress Testing**: Memory exhaustion scenarios, server stability under load
- **Concurrency Testing**: Multiple simultaneous imports to same service

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Round-trip Testing**: Export-import cycles with data validation
- **Error Handling Testing**: Invalid payload scenarios, user-friendly error messages
- **Export Performance Testing**: Large dataset streaming, query optimization

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- DATA-001: Mass data corruption (Critical)
- SEC-001: Authorization bypass (Critical)
- PERF-001: Memory exhaustion (High)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001: Deadlocks (with retry logic)
- DATA-002: Format issues (with schema validation)
- OPS-001: Error reporting (with basic error handling)

### Accepted Risks

- PERF-002: Export performance (acceptable for current scale)
- BUS-001: User expectations (can be addressed post-MVP)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: Import/export response times, memory usage patterns
- **Security Alerts**: Failed authorization attempts, suspicious import patterns
- **Error Rates**: Import failure rates, transaction rollback frequency
- **Business KPIs**: Import/export usage patterns, user satisfaction metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Import payload size limits are increased
- New authentication/authorization changes are implemented
- Database schema changes affect import/export
- Performance issues are reported in production
- New security vulnerabilities are discovered in JSON parsing libraries
