# TypeScript Style & Safety

- Use explicit types for exported functions and public APIs. Avoid `any`.
- Prefer `const` over `let`; avoid mutable state.
- Narrow types early; use Zod schemas for runtime validation.
- Handle errors with early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Do not catch errors without handling or rethrowing.
- Keep functions small and focused; extract helpers for clarity.
- Use named exports; avoid default exports in app code.
- Keep imports sorted and path‑aliased (`~/*`).
- Ensure all server‑only modules avoid importing client‑only code.
