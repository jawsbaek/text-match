# Event Archiving Strategy for Long-term Scalability

## Overview

The audit event system requires a comprehensive archiving strategy to maintain performance and manage storage costs as the system scales. This document outlines the approach for archiving old events while preserving audit compliance.

## Archiving Requirements

### Compliance Requirements

- **Retention Period**: Events must be retained for minimum 7 years for audit compliance
- **Immutability**: Archived events must remain immutable and tamper-evident
- **Accessibility**: Archived events must be accessible for compliance reviews and investigations
- **Chain of Custody**: Complete audit trail of archival operations

### Performance Requirements

- **Active Data**: Only keep 90 days of events in active database for optimal query performance
- **Archive Retrieval**: Archived data retrieval should complete within 30 seconds for compliance requests
- **Minimal Impact**: Archival process should not impact production performance

## Architecture Design

### Three-Tier Storage Strategy

1. **Hot Storage (0-90 days)**
   - PostgreSQL primary database
   - Full query capabilities with indexes
   - Real-time access for audit dashboard

2. **Warm Storage (90 days - 2 years)**
   - Compressed PostgreSQL partition or separate database
   - Basic query capabilities
   - Accessible via API with 1-2 second response time

3. **Cold Storage (2+ years)**
   - Object storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
   - Compressed, encrypted archive files
   - Requires special tooling for access

### Database Partitioning Strategy

```sql
-- Example partitioning by month
CREATE TABLE event_2024_01 PARTITION OF event
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

-- Indexes per partition
CREATE INDEX event_2024_01_entity_idx ON event_2024_01 (entity_type, entity_id);
CREATE INDEX event_2024_01_created_at_idx ON event_2024_01 (created_at);
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Partitioning (Month 1)

- Implement monthly table partitions for event table
- Create automated partition creation script
- Add partition pruning to improve query performance

### Phase 2: Warm Storage Migration (Month 2)

- Create separate audit database for warm storage
- Implement monthly migration job for 90+ day events
- Build API layer for cross-database queries

### Phase 3: Cold Storage Archival (Month 3)

- Implement S3/object storage integration
- Create compressed archive format (JSON + metadata)
- Build retrieval tooling for cold storage access

### Phase 4: Automated Lifecycle Management (Month 4)

- Automated monthly archival jobs
- Monitoring and alerting for archival processes
- Compliance reporting and verification tools

## Technical Implementation

### Archive Format

```typescript
interface ArchiveManifest {
  archiveId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  periodStart: Date;
  periodEnd: Date;
  eventCount: number;
  checksum: string;
  encryptionKey?: string;
}

interface ArchivedEvent {
  originalId: string;
  actor: string;
  action: string;
  entityType: string;
  entityId: string;
  before?: object;
  after?: object;
  createdAt: Date;
  archivedAt: Date;
  archiveVersion: string;
}
```

### Archival Service

```typescript
interface ArchivalService {
  // Archive events older than specified days
  archiveEvents(olderThanDays: number): Promise<ArchiveResult>;

  // Retrieve archived events by date range
  retrieveArchivedEvents(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): Promise<ArchivedEvent[]>;

  // Verify archive integrity
  verifyArchive(archiveId: string): Promise<boolean>;

  // Get archival status
  getArchivalStatus(): Promise<ArchivalStatus>;
}
```

### Database Cleanup Strategy

```typescript
interface CleanupJob {
  // Move events to warm storage
  moveToWarmStorage(olderThanDays: number): Promise<number>;

  // Move events to cold storage
  moveToColdStorage(olderThanDays: number): Promise<number>;

  // Clean up processed events from hot storage
  cleanupProcessedEvents(): Promise<number>;
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics

- **Archive Success Rate**: % of successful archival operations
- **Retrieval Performance**: Time to retrieve archived events
- **Storage Growth**: Rate of event data growth
- **Compliance Coverage**: % of required retention period covered

### Alerts

- Failed archival jobs
- Archive integrity failures
- Storage threshold breaches
- Slow retrieval performance

## Security Considerations

### Encryption

- Events containing PII must be encrypted at rest in archives
- Separate encryption keys for different archive periods
- Key rotation policy for long-term archives

### Access Control

- Archive access requires admin privileges
- All archive operations logged
- Compliance officer approval for archive retrieval

## Cost Optimization

### Storage Tiers

- **Hot (PostgreSQL)**: $0.23/GB/month - 90 days = ~$18/TB/year
- **Warm (Compressed PG)**: $0.12/GB/month - 22 months = ~$32/TB/year
- **Cold (S3 Glacier)**: $0.004/GB/month - 84 months = ~$3.36/TB/year

### Projected Savings

With 10TB of events/year growth:

- Without archiving: $230/month growing to $2,300/month after 10 years
- With archiving: $50/month (hot) + $8/month (warm) + $28/month (cold) = $86/month stable

## Implementation Files

The following files would be created to implement this strategy:

1. `src/lib/audit/archival-service.ts` - Core archival service
2. `src/lib/audit/partition-manager.ts` - Database partition management
3. `src/lib/audit/cold-storage.ts` - Object storage integration
4. `src/jobs/archive-events.ts` - Scheduled archival job
5. `src/lib/audit/archive-retrieval.ts` - Archive retrieval utilities

## Compliance Features

### Audit Trail

- All archival operations logged with checksums
- Immutable record of what was archived when
- Chain of custody documentation

### Retention Policies

- Configurable retention periods per event type
- Legal hold capabilities to prevent archival
- Compliance reporting dashboard

This strategy provides a scalable, compliant, and cost-effective approach to long-term event storage while maintaining system performance.
